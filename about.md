This is the teaching site of [potassco](https://potassco.org/),
the Potsdam Answer Set Solving Collection,
bundling tools for Answer Set Programming developed at the [University of Potsdam](https://uni-potsdam.de).

Answer Set Programming (ASP) offers a simple and powerful modeling language to solve combinatorial problems.
With our tools you can concentrate on an actual problem, rather than a smart way of implementing it.

You'll love it!
