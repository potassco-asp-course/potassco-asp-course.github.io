Just completed our part on Conflict-driven ASP solving, reaching from a nogood-based characterization of stable models
to the algorithmic framework underlying modern ASP solvers

 [slides](https://github.com/potassco-asp-course/course/releases/download/v1.11.6/solving.pdf)
 [videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7DBaibuDD9NFCpoQWNCvoSdhPE3kdzmM)
 [workspace](/solving/)

In addition, this material contains two blueboard sessions
  * conflict-driven nogood learning, search algorithm

along with a summary of

  * nogoods, solutions, and unit propagation
	[pdf](https://github.com/potassco-asp-course/course/releases/download/v1.11.6/nogoods-solutions-propagation.pdf)

and finally a great source for detailing the material

  * M. Gebser, B. Kaufmann, and T. Schaub (2012).
	“Conflict-Driven Answer Set Solving: From Theory to Practice”.
	In: Artificial Intelligence 187-188, pp. 52–89.
