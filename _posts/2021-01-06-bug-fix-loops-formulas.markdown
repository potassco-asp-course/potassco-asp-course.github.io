We found a first bug! The very last slide on **loop formulas reloaded** misses a technical detail:

The
[slides](https://github.com/potassco-asp-course/course/releases/download/v1.8.1/acharacterization.pdf)
underlying the video on loops have a bug on page 245: the theorem misses that set X must be a model of the program.
This is fixed in the
[new version](https://github.com/potassco-asp-course/course/releases/download/v1.11.1/acharacterization.pdf)
of the slides.
