Dear friends of ASP,

we hope you had a good start into 2021 and we are happy to see you return to our course!

We just uploaded the remaining sections of the part on operational characterizations:

  * unfounded sets

  * well-founded operator

  * summary

As well, we added two blueboard video caring about the well-founded operator, of course, with an emphasis on the concept
of unfounded sets:

  * well-founded operator, a

  * well-founded operator, b

Finally, we uploaded the slides on a proof-theoretic characterization but will not do any videos on this now,
since we'll skip it in the course ;)

That's it folks! Stay safe!
